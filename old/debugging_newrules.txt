Decide how many tricks you expect to win this round.
Legal bids are integers from 0 to 9 inclusive.
Your goal is to finish the round with tricks_won matching your bid, not to take every trick.
Return a JSON object: {"bid": <integer>}.

  - If it is a number card, its suit is the trump suit.
  - If it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP this round.
  - If it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses the trump suit.
- In the last round there is NO TRUMP (no card is turned up).
- In JSON, trump_suit is "RED" / "BLUE" / "GREEN" / "YELLOW" or null for no trump.

Tricks:
- Each round has r tricks; in each trick every player plays exactly one card.
- The first player to play leads the trick.
- The first NUMBER card played defines the led suit.
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit, you must play one of them,
  except you may always play WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If you have no NUMBER cards in the led suit, you may play any card.

Winning a trick:
- If any WIZARD is played, the FIRST WIZARD played wins the trick.
- Otherwise, if there is a trump suit:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the trump suit (rank 1–13) wins.
- Otherwise:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the led suit wins.
- If all cards are JESTERS (no Wizards, no number cards), the FIRST JESTER wins.

Bidding & scoring:
- Before playing tricks in a round, each player bids how many tricks they expect to win.
- After the round:
  - If tricks_won == bid: score change = 20 + 10 * tricks_won.
  - Otherwise: score change = -10 * |tricks_won - bid|.
- Total score is the sum of all round score changes.

Information & legality:
- You only see your own hand plus public information (trump, bids, tricks, scores).
- The environment enforces the rules and provides `legal_move_indices` in the JSON:
  those are the ONLY hand indices you are allowed to choose when playing a card.

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation.
Steer toward finishing the round with tricks_won matching your bid: avoid extra tricks if you are already at your bid; press to win when behind your bid.
Return JSON: {"card_index": <integer>}.
Do NOT include any explanations, only JSON.

- The first NUMBER card played defines the led suit.
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit, you must play one of them,
  except you may always play WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If you have no NUMBER cards in the led suit, you may play any card.

Winning a trick:
- If any WIZARD is played, the FIRST WIZARD played wins the trick.
- Otherwise, if there is a trump suit:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the trump suit (rank 1–13) wins.
- Otherwise:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the led suit wins.
- If all cards are JESTERS (no Wizards, no number cards), the FIRST JESTER wins.

Bidding & scoring:
- Before playing tricks in a round, each player bids how many tricks they expect to win.
- After the round:
  - If tricks_won == bid: score change = 20 + 10 * tricks_won.
  - Otherwise: score change = -10 * |tricks_won - bid|.
- Total score is the sum of all round score changes.

Information & legality:
- You only see your own hand plus public information (trump, bids, tricks, scores).
- The environment enforces the rules and provides `legal_move_indices` in the JSON:
  those are the ONLY hand indices you are allowed to choose when playing a card.

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation.
Steer toward finishing the round with tricks_won matching your bid: avoid extra tricks if you are already at your bid; press to win when behind your bid.

- Otherwise, if there is a trump suit:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the trump suit (rank 1–13) wins.
- Otherwise:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the led suit wins.
- If all cards are JESTERS (no Wizards, no number cards), the FIRST JESTER wins.

Bidding & scoring:

- After the round:
  - If tricks_won == bid: score change = 20 + 10 * tricks_won.
  - Otherwise: score change = -10 * |tricks_won - bid|.
- Total score is the sum of all round score changes.

Information & legality:
- You only see your own hand plus public information (trump, bids, tricks, scores).
- The environment enforces the rules and provides `legal_move_indices` in the JSON:
  those are the ONLY hand indices you are allowed to choose when playing a card.

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation.
Steer toward finishing the round with tricks_won matching your bid: avoid extra tricks if you are already at your bid; press to win when behind your bid.

=== gemini:gemini-2.0-flash-lite | choose_card ===
System prompt: You are choosing which card to play for this trick in Wizard. The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices`, which are the indices in your hand that you are allowed to play. You must pick one of those indices. Always output valid JSON.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Rules summary:
Game: Wizard, a trick-taking game.

Deck:
- 60 cards total.
- Suits: RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW.
- Number cards: 1–13 in each suit (1 lowest, 13 highest).
- 4 WIZARD cards and 4 JESTER cards (no suit, no rank).

Rounds & trump:
- Round r: each player is dealt r cards from a shuffled deck.
- One extra card may be turned face up to set trump:
  - If it is a number card, its suit is the trump suit.
  - If it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP this round.
  - If it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses the trump suit.
- In the last round there is NO TRUMP (no card is turned up).
- In JSON, trump_suit is "RED" / "BLUE" / "GREEN" / "YELLOW" or null for no trump.

Tricks:
- Each round has r tricks; in each trick every player plays exactly one card.
- The first player to play leads the trick.
- The first NUMBER card played defines the led suit.
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit, you must play one of them,
  except you may always play WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If you have no NUMBER cards in the led suit, you may play any card.

Winning a trick:
- If any WIZARD is played, the FIRST WIZARD played wins the trick.
- Otherwise, if there is a trump suit:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the trump suit (rank 1–13) wins.
- Otherwise:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the led suit wins.
- If all cards are JESTERS (no Wizards, no number cards), the FIRST JESTER wins.

Bidding & scoring:
- Before playing tricks in a round, each player bids how many tricks they expect to win.
- After the round:
  - If tricks_won == bid: score change = 20 + 10 * tricks_won.
  - Otherwise: score change = -10 * |tricks_won - bid|.
- Total score is the sum of all round score changes.

Information & legality:
- You only see your own hand plus public information (trump, bids, tricks, scores).
- The environment enforces the rules and provides `legal_move_indices` in the JSON:
  those are the ONLY hand indices you are allowed to choose when playing a card.

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation.
Steer toward finishing the round with tricks_won matching your bid: avoid extra tricks if you are already at your bid; press to win when behind your bid.
Return JSON: {"card_index": <integer>}.
Do NOT include any explanations, only JSON.

System prompt: You are choosing which card to play for this trick in Wizard. The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices`, which are the indices in your hand that you are allowed to play. You must pick one of those indices. Always output valid JSON.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Rules summary:
Game: Wizard, a trick-taking game.

Deck:
- 60 cards total.
- Suits: RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW.
- Number cards: 1–13 in each suit (1 lowest, 13 highest).
- 4 WIZARD cards and 4 JESTER cards (no suit, no rank).

Rounds & trump:
- Round r: each player is dealt r cards from a shuffled deck.
- One extra card may be turned face up to set trump:
  - If it is a number card, its suit is the trump suit.
  - If it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP this round.
  - If it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses the trump suit.
- In the last round there is NO TRUMP (no card is turned up).
- In JSON, trump_suit is "RED" / "BLUE" / "GREEN" / "YELLOW" or null for no trump.

Tricks:
- Each round has r tricks; in each trick every player plays exactly one card.
- The first player to play leads the trick.
- The first NUMBER card played defines the led suit.
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit, you must play one of them,
  except you may always play WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If you have no NUMBER cards in the led suit, you may play any card.

Winning a trick:
- If any WIZARD is played, the FIRST WIZARD played wins the trick.
- Otherwise, if there is a trump suit:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the trump suit (rank 1–13) wins.
- Otherwise:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the led suit wins.
- If all cards are JESTERS (no Wizards, no number cards), the FIRST JESTER wins.

Bidding & scoring:
- Before playing tricks in a round, each player bids how many tricks they expect to win.
- After the round:
  - If tricks_won == bid: score change = 20 + 10 * tricks_won.
  - Otherwise: score change = -10 * |tricks_won - bid|.
- Total score is the sum of all round score changes.

Information & legality:
- You only see your own hand plus public information (trump, bids, tricks, scores).
- The environment enforces the rules and provides `legal_move_indices` in the JSON:
  those are the ONLY hand indices you are allowed to choose when playing a card.

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation.
Steer toward finishing the round with tricks_won matching your bid: avoid extra tricks if you are already at your bid; press to win when behind your bid.
Return JSON: {"card_index": <integer>}.

System prompt: You are choosing which card to play for this trick in Wizard. The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices`, which are the indices in your hand that you are allowed to play. You must pick one of those indices. Always output valid JSON.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Rules summary:
Game: Wizard, a trick-taking game.

- 4 WIZARD cards and 4 JESTER cards (no suit, no rank).

Rounds & trump:
- Round r: each player is dealt r cards from a shuffled deck.
- One extra card may be turned face up to set trump:
  - If it is a number card, its suit is the trump suit.
  - If it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP this round.
  - If it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses the trump suit.
- In the last round there is NO TRUMP (no card is turned up).
- In JSON, trump_suit is "RED" / "BLUE" / "GREEN" / "YELLOW" or null for no trump.

Tricks:
- Each round has r tricks; in each trick every player plays exactly one card.
- The first player to play leads the trick.
- The first NUMBER card played defines the led suit.
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit, you must play one of them,
  except you may always play WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If you have no NUMBER cards in the led suit, you may play any card.

Winning a trick:
- If any WIZARD is played, the FIRST WIZARD played wins the trick.
- Otherwise, if there is a trump suit:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the trump suit (rank 1–13) wins.
- Otherwise:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the led suit wins.
- If all cards are JESTERS (no Wizards, no number cards), the FIRST JESTER wins.

Bidding & scoring:
- Before playing tricks in a round, each player bids how many tricks they expect to win.
- After the round:
  - If tricks_won == bid: score change = 20 + 10 * tricks_won.
  - Otherwise: score change = -10 * |tricks_won - bid|.
- Total score is the sum of all round score changes.

Information & legality:
- You only see your own hand plus public information (trump, bids, tricks, scores).
- The environment enforces the rules and provides `legal_move_indices` in the JSON:
  those are the ONLY hand indices you are allowed to choose when playing a card.

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation.
Steer toward finishing the round with tricks_won matching your bid: avoid extra tricks if you are already at your bid; press to win when behind your bid.

System prompt: You are choosing which card to play for this trick in Wizard. The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices`, which are the indices in your hand that you are allowed to play. You must pick one of those indices. Always output valid JSON.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Rules summary:
Game: Wizard, a trick-taking game.

Deck:
- 60 cards total.
- Suits: RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW.
- Number cards: 1–13 in each suit (1 lowest, 13 highest).
- 4 WIZARD cards and 4 JESTER cards (no suit, no rank).

Rounds & trump:
- Round r: each player is dealt r cards from a shuffled deck.
- One extra card may be turned face up to set trump:
  - If it is a number card, its suit is the trump suit.
  - If it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP this round.
  - If it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses the trump suit.
- In the last round there is NO TRUMP (no card is turned up).
- In JSON, trump_suit is "RED" / "BLUE" / "GREEN" / "YELLOW" or null for no trump.

Tricks:
- Each round has r tricks; in each trick every player plays exactly one card.
- The first player to play leads the trick.
- The first NUMBER card played defines the led suit.
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit, you must play one of them,
  except you may always play WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If you have no NUMBER cards in the led suit, you may play any card.

Winning a trick:
- If any WIZARD is played, the FIRST WIZARD played wins the trick.
- Otherwise, if there is a trump suit:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the trump suit (rank 1–13) wins.
- Otherwise:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the led suit wins.
- If all cards are JESTERS (no Wizards, no number cards), the FIRST JESTER wins.

Bidding & scoring:
- Before playing tricks in a round, each player bids how many tricks they expect to win.
- After the round:
  - If tricks_won == bid: score change = 20 + 10 * tricks_won.
  - Otherwise: score change = -10 * |tricks_won - bid|.
- Total score is the sum of all round score changes.

Information & legality:
- You only see your own hand plus public information (trump, bids, tricks, scores).
- The environment enforces the rules and provides `legal_move_indices` in the JSON:
  those are the ONLY hand indices you are allowed to choose when playing a card.

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation.
Steer toward finishing the round with tricks_won matching your bid: avoid extra tricks if you are already at your bid; press to win when behind your bid.
Return JSON: {"card_index": <integer>}.
Do NOT include any explanations, only JSON.

  - If tricks_won == bid: score change = 20 + 10 * tricks_won.
  - Otherwise: score change = -10 * |tricks_won - bid|.
- Total score is the sum of all round score changes.

Information & legality:
- You only see your own hand plus public information (trump, bids, tricks, scores).
- The environment enforces the rules and provides `legal_move_indices` in the JSON:
  those are the ONLY hand indices you are allowed to choose when playing a card.

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation.
Steer toward finishing the round with tricks_won matching your bid: avoid extra tricks if you are already at your bid; press to win when behind your bid.
Return JSON: {"card_index": <integer>}.
Do NOT include any explanations, only JSON.

System prompt: You are choosing which card to play for this trick in Wizard. The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices`, which are the indices in your hand that you are allowed to play. You must pick one of those indices. Always output valid JSON.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Rules summary:
Game: Wizard, a trick-taking game.

Deck:
- 60 cards total.
- Suits: RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW.
- Number cards: 1–13 in each suit (1 lowest, 13 highest).
- 4 WIZARD cards and 4 JESTER cards (no suit, no rank).

Rounds & trump:
- Round r: each player is dealt r cards from a shuffled deck.
- One extra card may be turned face up to set trump:
  - If it is a number card, its suit is the trump suit.
  - If it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP this round.
  - If it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses the trump suit.
- In the last round there is NO TRUMP (no card is turned up).
- In JSON, trump_suit is "RED" / "BLUE" / "GREEN" / "YELLOW" or null for no trump.

Tricks:
- Each round has r tricks; in each trick every player plays exactly one card.
- The first player to play leads the trick.
- The first NUMBER card played defines the led suit.
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit, you must play one of them,
  except you may always play WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If you have no NUMBER cards in the led suit, you may play any card.

Winning a trick:
- If any WIZARD is played, the FIRST WIZARD played wins the trick.
- Otherwise, if there is a trump suit:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the trump suit (rank 1–13) wins.
- Otherwise:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the led suit wins.
- If all cards are JESTERS (no Wizards, no number cards), the FIRST JESTER wins.

Bidding & scoring:
- Before playing tricks in a round, each player bids how many tricks they expect to win.
- After the round:
  - If tricks_won == bid: score change = 20 + 10 * tricks_won.
  - Otherwise: score change = -10 * |tricks_won - bid|.
- Total score is the sum of all round score changes.

Information & legality:
- You only see your own hand plus public information (trump, bids, tricks, scores).
- The environment enforces the rules and provides `legal_move_indices` in the JSON:
  those are the ONLY hand indices you are allowed to choose when playing a card.

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation.
Steer toward finishing the round with tricks_won matching your bid: avoid extra tricks if you are already at your bid; press to win when behind your bid.
Return JSON: {"card_index": <integer>}.

System prompt: You are choosing which card to play for this trick in Wizard. The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices`, which are the indices in your hand that you are allowed to play. You must pick one of those indices. Always output valid JSON.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Rules summary:
Game: Wizard, a trick-taking game.

Deck:
- 60 cards total.
- Suits: RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW.
- Number cards: 1–13 in each suit (1 lowest, 13 highest).
- 4 WIZARD cards and 4 JESTER cards (no suit, no rank).

Rounds & trump:
- Round r: each player is dealt r cards from a shuffled deck.
- One extra card may be turned face up to set trump:
  - If it is a number card, its suit is the trump suit.
  - If it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP this round.
  - If it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses the trump suit.
- In the last round there is NO TRUMP (no card is turned up).
- In JSON, trump_suit is "RED" / "BLUE" / "GREEN" / "YELLOW" or null for no trump.

Tricks:
- Each round has r tricks; in each trick every player plays exactly one card.
- The first player to play leads the trick.
- The first NUMBER card played defines the led suit.
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit, you must play one of them,
  except you may always play WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If you have no NUMBER cards in the led suit, you may play any card.

Winning a trick:
- If any WIZARD is played, the FIRST WIZARD played wins the trick.
- Otherwise, if there is a trump suit:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the trump suit (rank 1–13) wins.
- Otherwise:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the led suit wins.
- If all cards are JESTERS (no Wizards, no number cards), the FIRST JESTER wins.

Bidding & scoring:
- Before playing tricks in a round, each player bids how many tricks they expect to win.
- After the round:
  - If tricks_won == bid: score change = 20 + 10 * tricks_won.
  - Otherwise: score change = -10 * |tricks_won - bid|.
- Total score is the sum of all round score changes.

Information & legality:
- You only see your own hand plus public information (trump, bids, tricks, scores).
- The environment enforces the rules and provides `legal_move_indices` in the JSON:
  those are the ONLY hand indices you are allowed to choose when playing a card.

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation.
Steer toward finishing the round with tricks_won matching your bid: avoid extra tricks if you are already at your bid; press to win when behind your bid.
Return JSON: {"card_index": <integer>}.
Do NOT include any explanations, only JSON.

System prompt: You are choosing which card to play for this trick in Wizard. The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices`, which are the indices in your hand that you are allowed to play. You must pick one of those indices. Always output valid JSON.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Rules summary:
Game: Wizard, a trick-taking game.

Deck:
- 60 cards total.
- Suits: RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW.
- Number cards: 1–13 in each suit (1 lowest, 13 highest).
- 4 WIZARD cards and 4 JESTER cards (no suit, no rank).

Rounds & trump:
- Round r: each player is dealt r cards from a shuffled deck.
- One extra card may be turned face up to set trump:
  - If it is a number card, its suit is the trump suit.
  - If it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP this round.
  - If it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses the trump suit.
- In the last round there is NO TRUMP (no card is turned up).
- In JSON, trump_suit is "RED" / "BLUE" / "GREEN" / "YELLOW" or null for no trump.

Tricks:
- Each round has r tricks; in each trick every player plays exactly one card.
- The first player to play leads the trick.
- The first NUMBER card played defines the led suit.
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit, you must play one of them,
  except you may always play WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If you have no NUMBER cards in the led suit, you may play any card.

Winning a trick:
- If any WIZARD is played, the FIRST WIZARD played wins the trick.
- Otherwise, if there is a trump suit:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the trump suit (rank 1–13) wins.
- Otherwise:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the led suit wins.
- If all cards are JESTERS (no Wizards, no number cards), the FIRST JESTER wins.

Bidding & scoring:
- Before playing tricks in a round, each player bids how many tricks they expect to win.
- After the round:
  - If tricks_won == bid: score change = 20 + 10 * tricks_won.
  - Otherwise: score change = -10 * |tricks_won - bid|.
- Total score is the sum of all round score changes.

Information & legality:
- You only see your own hand plus public information (trump, bids, tricks, scores).
- The environment enforces the rules and provides `legal_move_indices` in the JSON:
  those are the ONLY hand indices you are allowed to choose when playing a card.

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation.
Steer toward finishing the round with tricks_won matching your bid: avoid extra tricks if you are already at your bid; press to win when behind your bid.
Return JSON: {"card_index": <integer>}.
