System prompt: You are a strong Wizard player focusing on accurate bidding. You want to maximize your final score, not just win individual rounds. Always output valid JSON.

Prompt sent to LLM:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Rules summary:

Game: Wizard, a trick-taking game.

Deck:
- 60 cards total.
- Suits: RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW.
- Number cards: 1–13 in each suit (1 lowest, 13 highest).
- 4 WIZARD cards and 4 JESTER cards (no suit, no rank).

Rounds & trump:
- Round r: each player is dealt r cards from a shuffled deck.
- One extra card may be turned face up to set trump:
  - If it is a number card, its suit is the trump suit.
  - If it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP this round.
  - If it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses the trump suit.
- In the last round there is NO TRUMP (no card is turned up).
- In JSON, trump_suit is "RED" / "BLUE" / "GREEN" / "YELLOW" or null for no trump.

Tricks:
- Each round has r tricks; in each trick every player plays exactly one card.
- The first player to play leads the trick.
- The first NUMBER card played defines the led suit.
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit, you must play one of them,
  except you may always play WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If you have no NUMBER cards in the led suit, you may play any card.

Winning a trick:
- If any WIZARD is played, the FIRST WIZARD played wins the trick.
- Otherwise, if there is a trump suit:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the trump suit (rank 1–13) wins.
- Otherwise:
  - Highest NUMBER card of the led suit wins.
- If all cards are JESTERS (no Wizards, no number cards), the FIRST JESTER wins.

Bidding & scoring:
- Before playing tricks in a round, each player bids how many tricks they expect to win.
- After the round:
  - If tricks_won == bid: score change = 20 + 10 * tricks_won.
  - Otherwise: score change = -10 * |tricks_won - bid|.
- Total score is the sum of all round score changes.

Information & legality:
- You only see your own hand plus public information (trump, bids, tricks, scores).
- The environment enforces the rules and provides `legal_move_indices` in the JSON:
  those are the ONLY hand indices you are allowed to choose when playing a card.

Observation JSON fields (key parts):
- game: round_index, cards_per_player, num_players, dealer_id.
- player: your id, name, score.
- trump: {suit, card}; scores: map of total scores; seating_order + player_names.
- Bidding phase adds: phase="bidding", hand, bids_so_far, bidding_order, current_bidder_seat_index.
- Play phase adds: phase="play", hand, legal_move_indices, trick_index, leader_id (player who led this current trick),
  current_trick (plays so far and led_suit), trick_history (prior tricks with led_suit/winner),
  bids, tricks_taken_so_far, hand_sizes (cards remaining per player).

This rules summary will only be sent once per game. Remember and follow it for every turn.

Decide how many tricks you expect to win this round.
Legal bids are integers from 0 to 2 inclusive.
Your goal is to finish the round with tricks_won matching your bid, not to take every trick.
Give a very short rationale if helpful, then end with FINAL_JSON: {"bid": <integer>} with nothing after the closing brace.

System prompt: You are choosing which card to play for this trick in Wizard. The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices`, which are the indices in your hand that you are allowed to play. You must pick one of those indices. Always output valid JSON.

Prompt sent to LLM:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Use the exact same rules you were given at the start of this game; they will not be repeated.

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation.
Steer toward finishing the round with tricks_won matching your bid: avoid extra tricks if you are already at your bid; press to win when behind your bid.
Give a brief rationale if helpful, then end with FINAL_JSON: {"card_index": <integer>} with nothing after the closing brace.
