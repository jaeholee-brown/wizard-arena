Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Essentials:
- 60-card deck: suits RED/BLUE/GREEN/YELLOW (number cards 1–13), plus 4 WIZARD and 4 JESTER cards (no suit).
- Trump: if the face-up card is a NUMBER, its suit is trump; if it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP; if it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses any trump suit; in the last round there is NO TRUMP.
- Trick lead: the first NUMBER card played in a trick sets the led suit, unless the trick is led with a WIZARD (no led suit is set).
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit you must play one of them, except that you may always play a WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If there is no led suit yet (for example because the trick was led with a WIZARD or JESTER and no NUMBER has been played), any card is legal.
- Trick winner: if any WIZARD is played, the earliest WIZARD wins; otherwise, if there is a trump suit, the highest NUMBER in the trump suit wins; otherwise, the highest NUMBER in the led suit wins; if all cards are JESTERs, the earliest JESTER wins.
- Card indices in your hand are 0-indexed; you may only choose an index from `legal_move_indices` when playing a card.
- Objective: by the end of the round, win exactly the number of tricks you bid (no more and no less).
- Scoring: if tricks_won == bid then your score change is +20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score change is -10 * abs(tricks_won - bid). Total score is cumulative across rounds.
- Information: you see only your own hand plus public data (trump, bids, tricks, scores). The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices` for valid plays.

Follow the Wizard rules above exactly. They are fixed for this entire game and do not change between turns.

Quick state digest (for fast reference; use the JSON below for full details):

Player 2 bid: 3; tricks_won: 0; Trump: GREEN; Current trick leader: 1; Cards in hand: 12; Legal moves: [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8] -> 1: YELLOW 6, 2: YELLOW 1, 3: YELLOW 8, 6: YELLOW 5, 7: YELLOW 13, 8: YELLOW 10

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation. Card indices are 0-indexed within your current hand.
Hand with indices: 0: BLUE 6, 1: YELLOW 6, 2: YELLOW 1, 3: YELLOW 8, 4: RED 8, 5: RED 2, 6: YELLOW 5, 7: YELLOW 13, 8: YELLOW 10, 9: BLUE 8, 10: RED 4, 11: BLUE 12
Legal move options (index -> card): 1: YELLOW 6, 2: YELLOW 1, 3: YELLOW 8, 6: YELLOW 5, 7: YELLOW 13, 8: YELLOW 10
Scoring reminder: if tricks_won == bid your score goes up by 20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score decreases by 10 * abs(tricks_won - bid).
If you include a rationale, keep it short, then end with FINAL_JSON: {"card_index": <integer>} with nothing after the closing brace.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Essentials:
- 60-card deck: suits RED/BLUE/GREEN/YELLOW (number cards 1–13), plus 4 WIZARD and 4 JESTER cards (no suit).
- Trump: if the face-up card is a NUMBER, its suit is trump; if it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP; if it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses any trump suit; in the last round there is NO TRUMP.
- Trick lead: the first NUMBER card played in a trick sets the led suit, unless the trick is led with a WIZARD (no led suit is set).
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit you must play one of them, except that you may always play a WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If there is no led suit yet (for example because the trick was led with a WIZARD or JESTER and no NUMBER has been played), any card is legal.
- Trick winner: if any WIZARD is played, the earliest WIZARD wins; otherwise, if there is a trump suit, the highest NUMBER in the trump suit wins; otherwise, the highest NUMBER in the led suit wins; if all cards are JESTERs, the earliest JESTER wins.
- Card indices in your hand are 0-indexed; you may only choose an index from `legal_move_indices` when playing a card.
- Objective: by the end of the round, win exactly the number of tricks you bid (no more and no less).
- Scoring: if tricks_won == bid then your score change is +20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score change is -10 * abs(tricks_won - bid). Total score is cumulative across rounds.
- Information: you see only your own hand plus public data (trump, bids, tricks, scores). The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices` for valid plays.

Follow the Wizard rules above exactly. They are fixed for this entire game and do not change between turns.

Quick state digest (for fast reference; use the JSON below for full details):

Player 1 bid: 2; tricks_won: 2; Trump: RED; Current trick leader: 0; Cards in hand: 4; Legal moves: [0, 2, 3] -> 0: BLUE 1, 2: BLUE 4, 3: BLUE 2

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation. Card indices are 0-indexed within your current hand.
Hand with indices: 0: BLUE 1, 1: RED 6, 2: BLUE 4, 3: BLUE 2
Legal move options (index -> card): 0: BLUE 1, 2: BLUE 4, 3: BLUE 2
Scoring reminder: if tricks_won == bid your score goes up by 20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score decreases by 10 * abs(tricks_won - bid).
If you include a rationale, keep it short, then end with FINAL_JSON: {"card_index": <integer>} with nothing after the closing brace.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Essentials:
- 60-card deck: suits RED/BLUE/GREEN/YELLOW (number cards 1–13), plus 4 WIZARD and 4 JESTER cards (no suit).
- Trump: if the face-up card is a NUMBER, its suit is trump; if it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP; if it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses any trump suit; in the last round there is NO TRUMP.
- Trick lead: the first NUMBER card played in a trick sets the led suit, unless the trick is led with a WIZARD (no led suit is set).
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit you must play one of them, except that you may always play a WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If there is no led suit yet (for example because the trick was led with a WIZARD or JESTER and no NUMBER has been played), any card is legal.
- Trick winner: if any WIZARD is played, the earliest WIZARD wins; otherwise, if there is a trump suit, the highest NUMBER in the trump suit wins; otherwise, the highest NUMBER in the led suit wins; if all cards are JESTERs, the earliest JESTER wins.
- Card indices in your hand are 0-indexed; you may only choose an index from `legal_move_indices` when playing a card.
- Objective: by the end of the round, win exactly the number of tricks you bid (no more and no less).
- Scoring: if tricks_won == bid then your score change is +20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score change is -10 * abs(tricks_won - bid). Total score is cumulative across rounds.
- Information: you see only your own hand plus public data (trump, bids, tricks, scores). The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices` for valid plays.

Follow the Wizard rules above exactly. They are fixed for this entire game and do not change between turns.

Quick state digest (for fast reference; use the JSON below for full details):

Player 1 bid: 3; tricks_won: 9; Trump: GREEN; Current trick leader: 0; Cards in hand: 3; Legal moves: [0, 1, 2] -> 0: YELLOW 7, 1: RED 8, 2: RED 6

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation. Card indices are 0-indexed within your current hand.
Hand with indices: 0: YELLOW 7, 1: RED 8, 2: RED 6
Legal move options (index -> card): 0: YELLOW 7, 1: RED 8, 2: RED 6
Scoring reminder: if tricks_won == bid your score goes up by 20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score decreases by 10 * abs(tricks_won - bid).
If you include a rationale, keep it short, then end with FINAL_JSON: {"card_index": <integer>} with nothing after the closing brace.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Essentials:
- 60-card deck: suits RED/BLUE/GREEN/YELLOW (number cards 1–13), plus 4 WIZARD and 4 JESTER cards (no suit).
- Trump: if the face-up card is a NUMBER, its suit is trump; if it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP; if it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses any trump suit; in the last round there is NO TRUMP.
- Trick lead: the first NUMBER card played in a trick sets the led suit, unless the trick is led with a WIZARD (no led suit is set).
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit you must play one of them, except that you may always play a WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If there is no led suit yet (for example because the trick was led with a WIZARD or JESTER and no NUMBER has been played), any card is legal.
- Trick winner: if any WIZARD is played, the earliest WIZARD wins; otherwise, if there is a trump suit, the highest NUMBER in the trump suit wins; otherwise, the highest NUMBER in the led suit wins; if all cards are JESTERs, the earliest JESTER wins.
- Card indices in your hand are 0-indexed; you may only choose an index from `legal_move_indices` when playing a card.
- Objective: by the end of the round, win exactly the number of tricks you bid (no more and no less).
- Scoring: if tricks_won == bid then your score change is +20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score change is -10 * abs(tricks_won - bid). Total score is cumulative across rounds.
- Information: you see only your own hand plus public data (trump, bids, tricks, scores). The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices` for valid plays.

Follow the Wizard rules above exactly. They are fixed for this entire game and do not change between turns.

Quick state digest (for fast reference; use the JSON below for full details):

Player 0 bid: 5; tricks_won: 1; Trump: BLUE; Current trick leader: 0; Cards in hand: 13; Legal moves: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] -> 0: WIZARD, 1: YELLOW 8, 2: RED 1, 3: GREEN 5, 4: JESTER, 5: RED 9, 6: BLUE 10, 7: GREEN 10, 8: RED 11, 9: BLUE 5, 10: BLUE 4, 11: GREEN 9, 12: BLUE 9

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation. Card indices are 0-indexed within your current hand.
Hand with indices: 0: WIZARD, 1: YELLOW 8, 2: RED 1, 3: GREEN 5, 4: JESTER, 5: RED 9, 6: BLUE 10, 7: GREEN 10, 8: RED 11, 9: BLUE 5, 10: BLUE 4, 11: GREEN 9, 12: BLUE 9
Legal move options (index -> card): 0: WIZARD, 1: YELLOW 8, 2: RED 1, 3: GREEN 5, 4: JESTER, 5: RED 9, 6: BLUE 10, 7: GREEN 10, 8: RED 11, 9: BLUE 5, 10: BLUE 4, 11: GREEN 9, 12: BLUE 9
Scoring reminder: if tricks_won == bid your score goes up by 20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score decreases by 10 * abs(tricks_won - bid).
If you include a rationale, keep it short, then end with FINAL_JSON: {"card_index": <integer>} with nothing after the closing brace.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Essentials:
- 60-card deck: suits RED/BLUE/GREEN/YELLOW (number cards 1–13), plus 4 WIZARD and 4 JESTER cards (no suit).
- Trump: if the face-up card is a NUMBER, its suit is trump; if it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP; if it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses any trump suit; in the last round there is NO TRUMP.
- Trick lead: the first NUMBER card played in a trick sets the led suit, unless the trick is led with a WIZARD (no led suit is set).
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit you must play one of them, except that you may always play a WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If there is no led suit yet (for example because the trick was led with a WIZARD or JESTER and no NUMBER has been played), any card is legal.
- Trick winner: if any WIZARD is played, the earliest WIZARD wins; otherwise, if there is a trump suit, the highest NUMBER in the trump suit wins; otherwise, the highest NUMBER in the led suit wins; if all cards are JESTERs, the earliest JESTER wins.
- Card indices in your hand are 0-indexed; you may only choose an index from `legal_move_indices` when playing a card.
- Objective: by the end of the round, win exactly the number of tricks you bid (no more and no less).
- Scoring: if tricks_won == bid then your score change is +20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score change is -10 * abs(tricks_won - bid). Total score is cumulative across rounds.
- Information: you see only your own hand plus public data (trump, bids, tricks, scores). The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices` for valid plays.

Follow the Wizard rules above exactly. They are fixed for this entire game and do not change between turns.

Quick state digest (for fast reference; use the JSON below for full details):

Player 2 bid: 3; tricks_won: 7; Trump: GREEN; Current trick leader: 0; Cards in hand: 1; Legal moves: [0] -> 0: RED 5

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation. Card indices are 0-indexed within your current hand.
Hand with indices: 0: RED 5
Legal move options (index -> card): 0: RED 5
Scoring reminder: if tricks_won == bid your score goes up by 20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score decreases by 10 * abs(tricks_won - bid).
If you include a rationale, keep it short, then end with FINAL_JSON: {"card_index": <integer>} with nothing after the closing brace.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Essentials:
- 60-card deck: suits RED/BLUE/GREEN/YELLOW (number cards 1–13), plus 4 WIZARD and 4 JESTER cards (no suit).
- Trump: if the face-up card is a NUMBER, its suit is trump; if it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP; if it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses any trump suit; in the last round there is NO TRUMP.
- Trick lead: the first NUMBER card played in a trick sets the led suit, unless the trick is led with a WIZARD (no led suit is set).
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit you must play one of them, except that you may always play a WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If there is no led suit yet (for example because the trick was led with a WIZARD or JESTER and no NUMBER has been played), any card is legal.
- Trick winner: if any WIZARD is played, the earliest WIZARD wins; otherwise, if there is a trump suit, the highest NUMBER in the trump suit wins; otherwise, the highest NUMBER in the led suit wins; if all cards are JESTERs, the earliest JESTER wins.
- Card indices in your hand are 0-indexed; you may only choose an index from `legal_move_indices` when playing a card.
- Objective: by the end of the round, win exactly the number of tricks you bid (no more and no less).
- Scoring: if tricks_won == bid then your score change is +20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score change is -10 * abs(tricks_won - bid). Total score is cumulative across rounds.
- Information: you see only your own hand plus public data (trump, bids, tricks, scores). The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices` for valid plays.

Follow the Wizard rules above exactly. They are fixed for this entire game and do not change between turns.

Quick state digest (for fast reference; use the JSON below for full details):

Player 2 bid: 2; tricks_won: 2; Trump: BLUE; Current trick leader: 2; Cards in hand: 12; Legal moves: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] -> 0: RED 6, 1: GREEN 2, 2: YELLOW 12, 3: BLUE 3, 4: YELLOW 13, 5: GREEN 9, 6: BLUE 10, 7: RED 5, 8: RED 3, 9: YELLOW 5, 10: WIZARD, 11: GREEN 12

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation. Card indices are 0-indexed within your current hand.
Hand with indices: 0: RED 6, 1: GREEN 2, 2: YELLOW 12, 3: BLUE 3, 4: YELLOW 13, 5: GREEN 9, 6: BLUE 10, 7: RED 5, 8: RED 3, 9: YELLOW 5, 10: WIZARD, 11: GREEN 12
Legal move options (index -> card): 0: RED 6, 1: GREEN 2, 2: YELLOW 12, 3: BLUE 3, 4: YELLOW 13, 5: GREEN 9, 6: BLUE 10, 7: RED 5, 8: RED 3, 9: YELLOW 5, 10: WIZARD, 11: GREEN 12
Scoring reminder: if tricks_won == bid your score goes up by 20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score decreases by 10 * abs(tricks_won - bid).
If you include a rationale, keep it short, then end with FINAL_JSON: {"card_index": <integer>} with nothing after the closing brace.

Follow the Wizard rules above exactly. They are fixed for this entire game and do not change between turns.

Quick state digest (for fast reference; use the JSON below for full details):

Player 1 bid: 3; tricks_won: 1; Trump: YELLOW; Current trick leader: 0; Cards in hand: 11; Legal moves: [1, 4, 5, 8] -> 1: GREEN 4, 4: GREEN 12, 5: GREEN 1, 8: GREEN 6

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation. Card indices are 0-indexed within your current hand.
Hand with indices: 0: YELLOW 4, 1: GREEN 4, 2: BLUE 12, 3: RED 7, 4: GREEN 12, 5: GREEN 1, 6: YELLOW 7, 7: RED 1, 8: GREEN 6, 9: RED 11, 10: RED 10
Legal move options (index -> card): 1: GREEN 4, 4: GREEN 12, 5: GREEN 1, 8: GREEN 6
Scoring reminder: if tricks_won == bid your score goes up by 20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score decreases by 10 * abs(tricks_won - bid).
If you include a rationale, keep it short, then end with FINAL_JSON: {"card_index": <integer>} with nothing after the closing brace.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Essentials:
- 60-card deck: suits RED/BLUE/GREEN/YELLOW (number cards 1–13), plus 4 WIZARD and 4 JESTER cards (no suit).
- Trump: if the face-up card is a NUMBER, its suit is trump; if it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP; if it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses any trump suit; in the last round there is NO TRUMP.
- Trick lead: the first NUMBER card played in a trick sets the led suit, unless the trick is led with a WIZARD (no led suit is set).
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit you must play one of them, except that you may always play a WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If there is no led suit yet (for example because the trick was led with a WIZARD or JESTER and no NUMBER has been played), any card is legal.
- Trick winner: if any WIZARD is played, the earliest WIZARD wins; otherwise, if there is a trump suit, the highest NUMBER in the trump suit wins; otherwise, the highest NUMBER in the led suit wins; if all cards are JESTERs, the earliest JESTER wins.
- Card indices in your hand are 0-indexed; you may only choose an index from `legal_move_indices` when playing a card.
- Objective: by the end of the round, win exactly the number of tricks you bid (no more and no less).
- Scoring: if tricks_won == bid then your score change is +20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score change is -10 * abs(tricks_won - bid). Total score is cumulative across rounds.
- Information: you see only your own hand plus public data (trump, bids, tricks, scores). The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices` for valid plays.

Follow the Wizard rules above exactly. They are fixed for this entire game and do not change between turns.

Quick state digest (for fast reference; use the JSON below for full details):

Player 1 bid: 3; tricks_won: 0; Trump: BLUE; Current trick leader: 1; Cards in hand: 13; Legal moves: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] -> 0: GREEN 9, 1: YELLOW 6, 2: RED 11, 3: BLUE 8, 4: YELLOW 10, 5: GREEN 3, 6: RED 9, 7: GREEN 13, 8: GREEN 2, 9: YELLOW 13, 10: YELLOW 5, 11: YELLOW 2, 12: BLUE 9

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation. Card indices are 0-indexed within your current hand.
Hand with indices: 0: GREEN 9, 1: YELLOW 6, 2: RED 11, 3: BLUE 8, 4: YELLOW 10, 5: GREEN 3, 6: RED 9, 7: GREEN 13, 8: GREEN 2, 9: YELLOW 13, 10: YELLOW 5, 11: YELLOW 2, 12: BLUE 9
Legal move options (index -> card): 0: GREEN 9, 1: YELLOW 6, 2: RED 11, 3: BLUE 8, 4: YELLOW 10, 5: GREEN 3, 6: RED 9, 7: GREEN 13, 8: GREEN 2, 9: YELLOW 13, 10: YELLOW 5, 11: YELLOW 2, 12: BLUE 9
Scoring reminder: if tricks_won == bid your score goes up by 20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score decreases by 10 * abs(tricks_won - bid).
If you include a rationale, keep it short, then end with FINAL_JSON: {"card_index": <integer>} with nothing after the closing brace.

Prompt:
You are playing the trick-taking card game Wizard. You must respect the game rules at all times.

Essentials:
- 60-card deck: suits RED/BLUE/GREEN/YELLOW (number cards 1–13), plus 4 WIZARD and 4 JESTER cards (no suit).
- Trump: if the face-up card is a NUMBER, its suit is trump; if it is a JESTER, there is NO TRUMP; if it is a WIZARD, the dealer chooses any trump suit; in the last round there is NO TRUMP.
- Trick lead: the first NUMBER card played in a trick sets the led suit, unless the trick is led with a WIZARD (no led suit is set).
- If you have any NUMBER cards in the led suit you must play one of them, except that you may always play a WIZARD or JESTER instead.
- If there is no led suit yet (for example because the trick was led with a WIZARD or JESTER and no NUMBER has been played), any card is legal.
- Trick winner: if any WIZARD is played, the earliest WIZARD wins; otherwise, if there is a trump suit, the highest NUMBER in the trump suit wins; otherwise, the highest NUMBER in the led suit wins; if all cards are JESTERs, the earliest JESTER wins.
- Card indices in your hand are 0-indexed; you may only choose an index from `legal_move_indices` when playing a card.
- Objective: by the end of the round, win exactly the number of tricks you bid (no more and no less).
- Scoring: if tricks_won == bid then your score change is +20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score change is -10 * abs(tricks_won - bid). Total score is cumulative across rounds.
- Information: you see only your own hand plus public data (trump, bids, tricks, scores). The environment has already computed `legal_move_indices` for valid plays.

Follow the Wizard rules above exactly. They are fixed for this entire game and do not change between turns.

Quick state digest (for fast reference; use the JSON below for full details):

Player 1 bid: 2; tricks_won: 3; Trump: RED; Current trick leader: 1; Cards in hand: 4; Legal moves: [0, 1, 2, 3] -> 0: GREEN 3, 1: GREEN 1, 2: YELLOW 3, 3: BLUE 1

Pick exactly one integer index from the `legal_move_indices` list in the observation. Card indices are 0-indexed within your current hand.
Hand with indices: 0: GREEN 3, 1: GREEN 1, 2: YELLOW 3, 3: BLUE 1
Legal move options (index -> card): 0: GREEN 3, 1: GREEN 1, 2: YELLOW 3, 3: BLUE 1
Scoring reminder: if tricks_won == bid your score goes up by 20 + 10 * bid; otherwise your score decreases by 10 * abs(tricks_won - bid).
If you include a rationale, keep it short, then end with FINAL_JSON: {"card_index": <integer>} with nothing after the closing brace.
